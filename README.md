# Movie Madness

User Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute


This is a static website intended to give users a guide to the top current films and some top selected films.
It is divided into four sections.
The Oscars section lists some of the winners of the lastest Oscars.
The Genre section allows the user to see some of the creators selected movies of certain genres.
The Top Picks section shows the IMBd top ten films of all time.
The Subscribe section allow the user to sign up to a newsletter although this feature does not work.

A live version can be found [Here](https://dmongey101.github.io/Movie-Madness/).

## UX

The design was kept simple. The webiste is dark in colour to try and replicate a movie theatre. The video on the homepage makes the movie theatre theme more realistic with it continuing down the edges on large and medium screens to keep the user in the theme all through the website.
The gold font replicates the colour of the oscars.

### No Template was used

User requirements are met in the following ways:

* The navbar is fully functional and links to the different segments on the page.
* The links to buy the movies are fully functional.

## Wireframing
    
Wireframes were made on pen and paper.


## Technologies Used

## Testing

The sites responsiveness was tested using Google developer tools. All devices provided were tested.

User testing was done to ensure:

* Links to other sites make use of target="_blank", so as to open the linked site in a new tab.
* The email form gives an error if a required field is not filled in.
* The email input gives an error if an email is entered in an incorrect format.
* The navbar links link to the correct section of the site for the link clicked on.
* All hover and visited effects work correctly and as intended.
* The video plays on loop as intended.
